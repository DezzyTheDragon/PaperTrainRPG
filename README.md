<h1>PaperTrainRPG</h1>
An RPG game inspired by PMTTYD but with more horror like themes and imagry.

<h2>Style</h2>
<p>The idea is to leverage the difference between 2D and 3D. Most characters will be 2D while odd/supernatrual elements are 3D. 2D artsyle is intended to be spooky but not overly detailed. Possibly a rough and sketchy style. 3D style should be simple and styalized, throwback to mid 2000 style possibly. The goal isn't to be hyper realistic but styalized to match the 2D art.</p>

<h3>2D elements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Player character</li>
    <li>Friendly NPCs</li>
    <li>Normal Objects</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Train</li>
            <li>Train stations</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Story</h2>
<h3>Demo portion</h3>
<p>Manned wolf girl has very recently lost her job. To clear her head she goes urban exploring, hearing of an abandon train station in a nearby forest on some internet forum. She goes and the station and off the bat it feels very off and unusual. From the outside it appears to be a small station but inside it is large and expansive. She makes her way into the basement where the message on the forum recomended she go and finds a \<platonic shape\>. Just as she reaches out to touch it she gets attacked by a monster. At this point the \<PLATONIC SHAPE\> seems to "chose" her and transforms into some sort of spell book. The book speaks to her and together they chase off the monster. Returning to the train platform the train appears out of nowhere.</p>
